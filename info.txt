Bashonu: Preserving the Songs of Chitrali Culture

Welcome to our website dedicated to preserving the precious songs of the Khowar language. Over time, our rich musical heritage has been gradually fading away, leaving our invaluable songs at the risk of being forgotten. They are a treasure trove of our history and heritage, and we believe that they should be preserved for all to enjoy. To combat this, we have created a platform where individuals can upload the lyrics of the songs they know, ensuring that they are forever saved and cherished.

Our website not only serves as a repository for Khowar song lyrics but also provides a convenient solution for singers who no longer need to carry around physical notebooks. With this platform, we aim to unite all lovers of Chitrali music, offering a comprehensive and accessible resource for Khowar songs.

Join us in our mission to safeguard our cultural treasures. Together, let's create a lasting legacy for Khowar music and ensure that future generations can embrace and celebrate our ancestral songs.
